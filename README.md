============

This is a node.js based IMAP client. There have been others, but I really hope to focus on optimizing user experience to make a client people will love to use.

My hope is that by the end I'll have something like [Roundcube](http://roundcube.net) which supports multiple IMAP accounts, has a killer UI, and is super snappy.

This is open source now and always so people can install it on their own servers.
